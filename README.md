# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to perform analysis on city types such as Rural, Suburban, and Urban using the Pyber dataset.I looked at the total rides, total drivers, and total fares of each city type. I also did some exploratory analysis to get the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver.

## Results

It is clear that it is cheaper in Urban areas for rides compared to Rural and Suburban. Over populated areas such as Urban bring in more money and have more people as well riding and driving. 

## Summary
Based on the analysis Urban city types are the only city that can meet the demand for the amount of rides the city has. There should be focus to increase the amount of drivers for Suburan and Rural, so maybe they can increase the amount of Total Fares.
